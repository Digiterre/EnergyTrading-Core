Breaking change - Moved EntityFramework related code to Nexus.EntityFramework, should affect few clients.
Remove UnityExtensions.CheckResolve, breaking change but shouldn't affect clients - use TryResolve instead.
Fixed issue - scavenging files in sub-directories now occurs when monitorSubDirectories is set to true on the file processor
